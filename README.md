 AI Resume Summary Generator
A microservice for dynamic resume summary generation using structured user data
🚀 Overview

This module is part of the Resume System – Next-Gen Resume & Career Ecosystem.
It automatically generates professional, personalized resume summaries based on a user’s verified data — such as internships, courses, projects, and achievements.

Built using FastAPI, this service processes structured profile data and produces concise, technical, or leadership-style summaries in seconds.

✨ Key Features

🔹 AI-driven logic (deterministic, rule-based summary generation)

🔹 Supports multiple tones: concise, technical, and leadership

🔹 Integrates easily with any backend or resume builder frontend

🔹 JSON-based API for fast automation and real-time updates

🔹 Lightweight (no external AI dependencies)

🧩 System Role

This module powers the “AI/Automation Layer” of the Resume Ecosystem.
Whenever a user adds or updates verified achievements, the platform calls this service to auto-refresh the “Professional Summary” section of their resume.
